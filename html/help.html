            <p>1. The goal of blackjack is simple - to get as close as possible to 21 without going over, and to have a
                higher hand than the dealer. If the dealer goes over the score of 21, they bust and lose the game. The
                same
                goes for you.</p>
            <p>2. Your Move: Decide whether to 'Hit' or 'Stand'.</p>
            <p>3. Choose to 'Hit':
                Ask the dealer for another card. Do this when, based on the current value of your cards, either you're
                sure
                that the next card will not cause you going bust, or you're willing to run the risk of getting a better
                hand
                than
                the dealer. |OR| Choose to 'Stand': Ask the dealer to move on and deal you no more cards. You'll
                probably do
                this when the value
                of your cards is quite high already (e.g. 17 or greater)</p>
            <p>4. As a result of the move you just made, you will probably have a new hand value. You'll remain in the
                game
                if
                your
                hand is valued at 21 or anything less.</p>
            <p>5. After you have completed your move, the dealer will reveal their hand.</p>
            <p>6. If your hand is closer to 21 than that of the dealer, you bust the dealer and win OR If the dealer has
                21
                or a closer score to 21 than you, the dealer wins. </p>
